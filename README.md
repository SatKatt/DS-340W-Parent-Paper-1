## Repo Structure

The repo contains the following directories:

- `utils`: contains auxiliary code.

- `out`: the output is stored here (no output is uploaded to GitHub, so it must be created).

- `Data`: the input data is stored here.

- `trained-models`: contains only best trained models for the end users.


## Training models

In order to train a fresh model, use `main.py`. 

```python
python main.py
```
There are lots of input commands that can be given to the script. To query them, use the `-h` flag (`python main.py -h`).
